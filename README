NAME
    Complete::BashGen - Generate bash completion scripts

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.00 of Complete::BashGen (from Perl
    distribution Complete-BashGen), released on 2014-07-02.

DESCRIPTION
    NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.

    First of all, read Complete::Bash. This module provides an alternative
    to that module. Instead of having your Perl program called by bash as an
    external command every time user presses Tab, you use Perl to *generate*
    bash "complete" scripts for you.

    Other CPAN modules doing the same: Term::Bash::Completion::Generator.
